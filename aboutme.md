I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science at the **University of Texas at San Antonio**. I have previously interned at **CrowdStrike** as a Security Engineer Intern focusing on detection engineering, and at **Booz Allen Hamilton** as a Red Team Operator Intern for commercial clients. 

I have always been a tinkerer and had a particular interest in computers and how they worked. I never knew that this interest would turn into a career, but ever since I competed in a national cybersecurity competition in middle and high school (2015), I became hooked on InfoSec and knew that it would be what I wanted to dedicate my life to.

As a perpetual student, I am always looking to sharpen my skills by playing CTFs, taking live and on-demand training, and attending conferences or local hacking meetups. My interests have fluctuated over time, but my primary interests are:
- Adversary Emulation 
- DFIR
- Windows and MacOS Internals
- Reverse Engineering
- Exploit Development

I love contributing to the infosec community and I'm constantly looking for new opportunities to learn from others. I never want to be the smartest in the room! In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, attending live music events, playing rhythm games, and playing with my dog :).

I made this blog to document interesting things I do that I think others could enjoy or benefit from reading. I encourage feedback on all my posts. Never hesititate to reach out on X or LinkedIn!

Cheers!
